 Congratulations to those who have devoted such industry and staggering learning to this. 

 First thought: Paul Theoroff's Online Gotha will normally at least show who is alive and dead and is up-to-date on descendants.   

 Second thought: Since this is entitled Line of succession to the British Throne, would it be possible to number those actually in line of succession but to include in the list, without numbering, those who have been skipped.  This could be quite transparent and helpful for making future corrections.",0,0,0,0,0,0
25a0657f649de590,"You should go to the Scottish Highands - and even certain parts of the lowlands - and see where that argument gets you... The same goes for Brittany, where a strong separatist movement exists.  

It's a strange argument, but I suspect Sleeping Water has not been to Scotland. In fairness, his argument would hold for former celtic areas that have integrated, like Cumbria or Devon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
3a1294f4a3c075ba,"I'm not the one you have to convince, it is the many, many others.  You know me well enough to know I don't take offense if someone reverts me, even if I disagree with it.  I'm more tolerant of that kind of stuff than the average bear.  You also know me well enough that my logic nor words can't be twisted around so easily, and that I wouldn't have declined unless I felt that was the appropriate response after careful deliberation.  While I will remain open minded, I'm not currently convinced that unblocking is in the best interest of Wikipedia at this time.  It was not a drive by decline, nor prompted or requested by anyone, and I chose to consider it because it has sat for almost 10 hours with no one willing to consider the issue.  If you choose to unblock him, I am not going to labor the issue with you personally, our friendship is certainly stronger than that, but others may not be so forgiving unless there is a clear path forward.  In my opinion, there is trollish behavior involved, crafty but subtle.  As always, anyone is free to discount or ignore my opinions if they so choose, without fear of reprisal.   - 2¢  ©  Join WER",0,0,0,0,0,0
2c8577fa55fd7e66,"Why would anyone use a noise weighting curve to assess hearing damage? That would indeed be stupid, as there is no reason at all to suppose that there is any correlation between apparent loudness and damage. I stick to my argument that 468 is the only curve actually designed for noise assessment, for reasons given, and that A-weighting is very wrong for the job (it doesn't even have a proper HF rolloff anything like that of the equal-loudness contours). Assessing music is something yet again, and since it is sometimes noise-like and sometimes pure tones it really needs something more complex than a weighting curve, based on proper combination of the outputs of a bank of narrow band filter.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Now I keep getting logged out because of my cookies...

When I see how idiotic Vietnam, the Gulf War and now the Iraqi invasion are it makes me wonder if there was ever a valid reason some time in the remote past to keep armies...
